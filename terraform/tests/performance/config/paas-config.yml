# Notes on PaaS characteristics for this test:
# - Automatic scaling based on rules (CPU, Memory, HTTP queue)
# - Managed infrastructure and OS updates
# - Built-in load balancing across instances
# - Cold start may occur if app was idle
# - Azure Application Insights integration available
# - Cost based on service plan tier, not actual usage
# - Scaling rules may take 2-5 minutes to trigger
# - Consider warm-up period for auto-scaling tests

# Auto-scaling considerations:
# - Scale-out triggers: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
# - Scale-in triggers: CPU < 30% for 10 minutes
# - Min instances: 1
# - Max instances: 5 (or configured limit)
# - Cool-down period: 5 minutes between scale operations
