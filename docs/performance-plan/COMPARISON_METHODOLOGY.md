## 1. Comparison Overview

This document defines the standardized methodology for comparing performance characteristics between IaaS (Azure Virtual Machines) and PaaS (Azure App Service) deployments in the TerraCloud project.

### Objectives
- Ensure fair and objective comparison between infrastructure models
- Identify performance trade-offs and strengths of each approach
- Provide data-driven recommendations for infrastructure selection
- Document cost-performance ratios

---

## 2. Comparison Principles

### 2.1 Fair Comparison Guidelines

**Equivalent Workload:**
- Both systems must run identical application code
- Same application version and configuration
- Identical test scenarios and parameters
- Same test data sets

**Comparable Resources:**
- Similar compute capacity (CPU cores, memory)
- Equivalent network bandwidth
- Comparable storage performance
- Similar pricing tier when possible

**Controlled Variables:**
- Tests run from same geographic location
- Similar time of day to account for Azure region load
- Same network conditions
- Identical test duration and patterns

**Documented Differences:**
- Configuration differences must be documented
- Resource tier differences must be noted
- Managed service features (auto-scaling, load balancing) acknowledged

### 2.2 Comparison Dimensions

| Dimension | Importance | Measurement Method |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Response Time | Critical | Artillery metrics, Azure Monitor |
| Throughput | Critical | Requests per second |
| Scalability | High | Load test progression analysis |
| Resource Efficiency | High | Azure Monitor CPU/Memory metrics |
| Cost Efficiency | Critical | Azure cost analysis |
| Reliability | High | Error rates, availability metrics |
| Operational Overhead | Medium | Qualitative assessment |
| Flexibility | Medium | Configuration options analysis |

## 4. Metrics Collection and Normalization

### 4.1 Primary Metrics

**Response Time Metrics:**
- Minimum, Average, Median, Maximum
- p95 (95th percentile)
- p99 (99th percentile)

**Throughput Metrics:**
- Total requests
- Successful requests
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Scenarios completed

**Error Metrics:**
- Total errors
- Error rate (%)
- Error types distribution

**Resource Metrics:**
- CPU utilization (average, peak)
- Memory usage (average, peak)
- Network I/O (average, peak)
- Disk I/O (if applicable)

### 4.2 Normalization Approach

**Response Time Normalization:**
- Use percentiles (p95, p99) for fair comparison
- Account for outliers in data analysis
- Consider cold start effects (especially for PaaS)

**Cost Normalization:**
```
Cost per 1000 requests = (Hourly infrastructure cost / 3600) * Test duration (seconds) / (Total requests / 1000)
```

**Resource Utilization Normalization:**
- Calculate utilization per request
- Compare efficiency: `Requests per CPU%`
- Compare throughput per cost unit

|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Avg Response Time | XXX ms | XXX ms | IaaS/PaaS | ±XX% |
| p95 Response Time | XXX ms | XXX ms | IaaS/PaaS | ±XX% |
| p99 Response Time | XXX ms | XXX ms | IaaS/PaaS | ±XX% |
| Throughput (RPS) | XX.X | XX.X | IaaS/PaaS | ±XX% |
| Error Rate | X.X% | X.X% | IaaS/PaaS | ±X.X% |

|--------|------|------|
| Setup Time | High (VM provisioning, configuration) | Low (quick deployment) |
| Maintenance | Manual updates, patches | Automatic updates |
| Monitoring | Custom setup required | Built-in monitoring |
| Scaling | Manual or configured VMSS | Automatic with rules |
| Flexibility | Complete control | Platform constraints |

**Scaling Behavior:**

## 6. Cost-Performance Analysis

### 6.1 Cost Calculation

**IaaS Cost Components:**
- VM compute cost (per hour)
- Load balancer cost
- Network egress cost
- Storage cost
- Management overhead (estimated)

**PaaS Cost Components:**
- App Service Plan cost (per hour)
- Network egress cost
- Built-in features (included)

### 6.2 Cost-Performance Ratio

**Calculation:**
```
Cost-Performance Score = (Throughput / Average Response Time) / Hourly Cost
Higher score = Better cost-performance
```

**Example:**
```
IaaS Score = (100 RPS / 200ms) / $0.50 = 1.0
PaaS Score = (120 RPS / 180ms) / $0.75 = 0.89
```

### 6.3 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

| Cost Factor | IaaS | PaaS |
|-------------|------|------|
| Infrastructure Cost | $XXX/month | $XXX/month |
| Management Time | XX hours/month @ $XX/hr | X hours/month @ $XX/hr |
| Monitoring Tools | $XX/month | Included |
| Scaling Automation | Custom development | Built-in |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$XXX** | **$XXX** |

## 7. Decision Framework

### 7.1 Scoring System

Assign weighted scores (1-10) for each criterion:

| Criterion | Weight | IaaS Score | PaaS Score | IaaS Weighted | PaaS Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Performance | 25% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| Cost | 20% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| Scalability | 20% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| Reliability | 15% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| Ease of Management | 10% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| Flexibility | 10% | X | X | X.XX | X.XX |
| **Total** | **100%** | - | - | **X.XX** | **X.XX** |

### 7.2 Recommendation Guidelines

**Choose IaaS when:**
- Maximum control and customization required
- Specific OS or software configurations needed
- Complex networking requirements
- Lower cost at scale with in-house expertise
- Performance score > PaaS by 20%+ AND team has DevOps expertise

**Choose PaaS when:**
- Rapid deployment is priority
- Limited DevOps resources
- Built-in scaling and monitoring sufficient
- Standard application architecture
- Performance score within 15% of IaaS OR operational simplicity valued

**Hybrid Approach when:**
- Some components need IaaS flexibility
- Other components benefit from PaaS simplicity
- Gradual migration strategy preferred

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Cold Start Effect**: Warm up systems before actual test
2. **Network Variability**: Test from consistent location
3. **Time of Day Effects**: Note Azure region peak hours
4. **Insufficient Stabilization**: Wait between tests
5. **Apples to Oranges**: Ensure configurations are comparable
6. **Ignoring Context**: Document all relevant factors
7. **Cherry-Picking Data**: Report all results objectively

### Useful Azure CLI Commands

```bash
# Get VM metrics
az monitor metrics list --resource <vm-resource-id> \
  --metric "Percentage CPU" --start-time <start> --end-time <end>

# Get App Service metrics
az monitor metrics list --resource <app-service-resource-id> \
  --metric "CpuPercentage" --start-time <start> --end-time <end>

# Get cost data
