# TerraCloud Performance Testing Strategy

## Document Information
- **Project**: TerraCloud Infrastructure Comparison (IaaS vs PaaS)
- **Task**: SETUP-05 - Performance Testing Strategy and Plan
- **Owner**: Syrine Ladhari
- **Version**: 1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the performance testing strategy for the TerraCloud project, which aims to compare Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) deployments on Microsoft Azure. The testing framework uses Artillery.js to conduct comprehensive load, stress, and spike tests on both infrastructure models.

### Objectives
- Measure and compare performance characteristics of IaaS vs PaaS deployments
- Identify performance bottlenecks and resource limitations
- Provide data-driven insights for infrastructure decision-making
- Establish performance baselines for future optimization

### Key Metrics
- **Response Time**: Average, median, p95, p99 latency
- **Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, network bandwidth
- **Scalability**: Performance under varying load conditions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Performance per dollar spent

## 2. Scope and Test Environments

### 4.3 Test Execution Process

1. **Pre-Test Checklist:**
   - Verify target URLs are accessible
   - Ensure Azure resources are running
   - Clear application logs and metrics
   - Notify team of test schedule
   - Document current resource configurations

2. **Execution Steps:**
   ```bash
   # Test IaaS deployment
   artillery run -e iaas tests/performance/scenarios/normal-load.yml

   # Test PaaS deployment
   artillery run -e paas tests/performance/scenarios/normal-load.yml
   ```

3. **Post-Test Activities:**
   - Collect Artillery reports
   - Export Azure Monitor metrics
   - Document any errors or anomalies
   - Save results with timestamps
   - Compare with previous results
